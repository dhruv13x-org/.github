# Organization-Wide GitHub Configuration

This repository contains global GitHub community health files for the
`dhruv13x-org` organization. These files automatically apply to all
repositories under the organization.

Included:

- **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md**
- **CONTRIBUTING.md**
- **SECURITY.md**
- **SUPPORT.md**
- **Issue Templates** (Bug Report, Feature Request)
- **Pull Request Template**

These files provide consistent guidance, standards, and contributor
experience across all repositories in the organization.

Do not place project-specific files here — only organization-wide templates.
